# LOFAR VLBI pipeline

The Low-Frequency Array Very Long Baseline Interferometry (LOFAR-VLBI) pipeline is a calibration and imaging pipeline that includes all of LOFARâ€™s international stations.
This is an implementation of the LOFAR-VLBI pipeline in the Common Workflow Language, which will eventually replace the [Genericpipeline](https://github.com/lmorabit/lofar-vlbi) implementation.

Instruction on installation, configuration and usage of the pipeline can be found in the dedicated [wiki](https://git.astron.nl/RD/VLBI-cwl/-/wikis/home).
